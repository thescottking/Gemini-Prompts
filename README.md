<b>Transcription Prompt</B>

Objective: Edit the transcript for grammar, spelling, punctuation. Do not remove content to preserve the full content and speaker intent.

Steps:

Remove Timestamps: Delete all timestamps.

Grammar & Punctuation: Fix grammatical errors (e.g., subject-verb agreement, tense inconsistencies). Correct punctuation mistakes (e.g., missing commas, misplaced periods).

Capitalize proper nouns and the beginning of sentences.

Content Preservation:

Do not: Do not condense the content. Use all of the content to maintain the speaker's thoughts, opinions, and points of view. 

Do: Remove filler works and hesitations ("um," "uh", "like").

Maintain: The natural flow of conversation, including pauses and interruptions. The speaker's unique voice and style.

Ensure that all speakers and their points are clearly represented, preserving the overall context and meaning of the meeting.

Additional Notes:

If unsure about a specific grammatical point or unclear phrasing, make a bracketed note to revisit later. You can maintain italics or bold formatting for emphasis if present in the original transcript.

I will paste the transcript in multiple parts since it is long.

Do you understand?
