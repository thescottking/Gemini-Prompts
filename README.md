<p>“Objective: Edit the transcript for grammar, spelling, punctuation. Do not remove content to preserve the full content and speaker intent.</p>



<p>Steps:</p>

<p>I will paste the transcript in multiple parts since it is long.</p>

<ul>
<li>Use short choppy sentences. These are easier to comprehend for people that are being interrupted.</li>



<li>Don’t ask for 15 minutes. No one wants this.</li>



<li>Focus on one pain point at a time. This enables you more material over time rather than saying everything at once then “bumping” your message. &lt;Cringe!</li>



<li>Offer to email back and forth. I find this more valuable since it requires thinking other than “virtual coffee.”</li>



<li>Send helpful data. Don’t send links to datashits. Instead copy and paste the value points so they can be read on a mobile device.</li>



<li>Final Note:
<ul>
<li>Remember to tailor the email further based on additional insights you have about the prospect to enhance personalization and relevance. The more context you provide to ChatGPT, the better. Many prompts lack contextual instructions and produce bland results. Be specific.</li>
