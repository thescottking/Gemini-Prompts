Transcription Prompt

Objective: Refine the transcript for clarity and readability while preserving the full content and speaker intent.

Steps:

Remove Timestamps: Delete all timestamps and speaker identifiers within the transcript.
Grammar & Punctuation:
Fix grammatical errors (e.g., subject-verb agreement, tense inconsistencies).
Correct punctuation mistakes (e.g., missing commas, misplaced periods).
Capitalize proper nouns and the beginning of sentences.
Content Preservation:
Do not: Condense the content or remove spoken elements like hesitations or fillers ("um," "uh").
Maintain:
The natural flow of conversation, including pauses and interruptions.
The speaker's unique voice and style.
Ensure:
All speakers and their points are clearly represented.
The overall context and meaning of the meeting is preserved.
Example (Before & After):

Before (with timestamps):
Speaker 1 (00:15.951) So, to start today's meeting, I wanted to discuss the upcoming project deadline.
Speaker 2 (00:16.571) Um, yeah, I was actually going to bring that up too.
After:

Speaker 1: To start today's meeting, I wanted to discuss the upcoming project deadline.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was actually going to bring that up too.
Additional Notes:

If unsure about a specific grammatical point or unclear phrasing, make a bracketed note to revisit later.
You can maintain italics or bold formatting for emphasis if present in the original transcript.
